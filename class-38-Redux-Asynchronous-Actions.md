# Redux - Asynchronous Actions
> ***Redux Thunk is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the store's dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the function's body once the asynchronous operations have been completed.***

> ***Asynchronous communication means communication which happens 'out of sync' or in other words; not in real-time.***

> ***That means asynchronous communications takes place as a less time-sensitive interchange between communicating parties. For example, an email to a colleague would be classed as asynchronous communication.***
