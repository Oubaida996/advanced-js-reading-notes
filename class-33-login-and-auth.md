### What is Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)?
Role-based access control (RBAC) is a technique of advanced access control that restricts network access based on a person’s role within an organization. The levels of access that employees have to the network are referred to as jobs in RBAC.

### Some of the designations in an RBAC tool can include:

1. Management role scope – it limits what objects the role group is allowed to manage.
2. Management role group – you can add and remove members.
3. Management role – these are the types of tasks that can be performed by a specific role group.
4. Management role assignment – this links a role to a role group.

***By adding a user to a role group, the user has access to all the roles in that group. If they are removed, access becomes restricted. Users may also be assigned to multiple groups in the event they need temporary access to certain data or programs and then removed once the project is complete.***

#### Other options for user access may include:

1. Primary – the primary contact for a specific account or role.
2. Billing – access for one end-user to the billing account.
3. Technical – assigned to users that perform technical tasks.
4. Administrative – access for users that perform administrative tasks.


### BENEFITS OF RBAC

1. Managing and auditing network access is essential to information security. Access can and should be granted on a need-to-know basis. With hundreds or thousands of employees, security is more easily maintained by limiting unnecessary access to sensitive information based on each user’s established role within the organization. Other advantages include:

2. Reducing administrative work and IT support. With RBAC, you can reduce the need for paperwork and password changes when an employee is hired or changes their role. Instead, you can use RBAC to add and switch roles quickly and implement them globally across operating systems, platforms and applications. It also reduces the potential for error when assigning user permissions. This reduction in time spent on administrative tasks is just one of several economic benefits of RBAC. RBAC also helps to more easily integrate third-party users into your network by giving them pre-defined roles.
